### Definition of Software Engineering
Formal Definition (IEEE Standard)
“Software Engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.”

In Simple Words
Software engineering is like building software in the same professional way we build big projects like bridges, airplanes, or skyscrapers — with planning, design, testing, maintenance, and teamwork.

It’s not just “writing code.”
It’s about engineering software that is:

- Reliable
- Scalable
- Maintainable
- Cost-effective

Example : Imagine two people both want to create an e-commerce website.

- People as a coder approach
  - Description - Starts coding immediately without planning, documentation, or testing.	
  - Result - Works at first, but breaks easily, hard to update.

- People as a software engineer approach
  - Description - Plans requirements, designs the system architecture, writes clean modular code, tests it, and maintains version control.
  - Result - Stable, scalable, and easy to update.

The second approach is software engineering.

### Scope of Software Engineering

The scope defines the areas and responsibilities included in the field.
Software engineering covers the entire lifecycle of software — from idea to retirement.

#### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Stages

1. Requirements Analysis Stage
   - Description : Understanding what the user or client needs.
   - Example : “Users should log in using email or Google.”

2. System Design Stage
   - Description : Planning the architecture, database, and UI.
   - Example : Decide to use React frontend + Node backend.

3. Implementation (Coding) Stage
   - Description : Writing actual code using chosen technologies.
   - Example : Write clean, modular code in TypeScript.

4. Testing Stage
   - Description : Checking that the software works correctly and has no bugs.
   - Example : Unit testing, integration testing, UI testing.

5. Deployment
    - Description : Delivering the software to users (e.g., on a web server).
    - Example : Deploy to Vercel or AWS.

6. Maintenance & Updates Stage
    - Description : Fixing bugs, improving features, updating dependencies.
    - Example : Add new payment gateways, fix crashes, etc.

#### Areas Included in Software Engineering

Software engineering is not only about programming — it includes:

- Project management
- Quality assurance
- Testing
- Software design
- Configuration management (Git, CI/CD)
- Software security
- User experience (UX)
- Documentation
- Maintenance

#### Real-World Example: Mobile Banking App

Scope includes:
- Requirement gathering (security, transactions, UI)
- Designing backend & frontend
- Developing using frameworks like React Native + Node.js
- Testing transactions, login, security
- Deploying on App Store / Play Store
- Updating and fixing bugs regularly

#### Key Takeaways

- Concept of Software Engineering
    - Systematic approach to building and maintaining software.

- Concept of Scope
    - Covers entire lifecycle: analysis → design → code → test → deploy → maintain.

- Concept of Goal
    - Deliver high-quality, reliable, maintainable, and cost-effective software.
