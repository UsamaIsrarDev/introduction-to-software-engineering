### Definition of Software Engineering
Formal Definition (IEEE Standard)
“Software Engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.”

In Simple Words
Software engineering is like building software in the same professional way we build big projects like bridges, airplanes, or skyscrapers — with planning, design, testing, maintenance, and teamwork.

It’s not just “writing code.”
It’s about engineering software that is:

- Reliable
- Scalable
- Maintainable
- Cost-effective

Example : Imagine two people both want to create an e-commerce website.

- People as a coder approach
  - Description - Starts coding immediately without planning, documentation, or testing.	
  - Result - Works at first, but breaks easily, hard to update.

- People as a software engineer approach
  - Description - Plans requirements, designs the system architecture, writes clean modular code, tests it, and maintains version control.
  - Result - Stable, scalable, and easy to update.

The second approach is software engineering.

### Scope of Software Engineering

The scope defines the areas and responsibilities included in the field.
Software engineering covers the entire lifecycle of software — from idea to retirement.
