## What is Software Crisis

### Definition
> The **Software Crisis** refers to the problems faced during the early days of software development, when projects became **large, complex, and difficult to manage**.  
> It occurs when software projects are **late, over budget, buggy, or fail to meet user needs**.

### Historical Background
- In the 1960s–1980s, computers became powerful and software systems grew in size.  
- Developers lacked structured methods, documentation, and testing.  
- Many projects **failed or became unmaintainable**, leading to the term “Software Crisis.”

## Causes of Software Crisis

### Lack of Proper Methodology
Projects had no defined process (like SDLC), leading to chaos and miscommunication.

### Increasing Complexity
Large programs were difficult to manage and understand.

### Poor Project Management
No time estimation, unclear roles, lack of coordination.

### Unclear Requirements
User needs were often unknown or constantly changing.

### Low Reliability
Software crashed, gave wrong outputs, or failed in critical systems.

### Poor Maintenance
Updating or fixing software was expensive and difficult.

### Lack of Skilled Developers
Few professionals understood large system design.

## Effects of Software Crisis

- Projects failed or were abandoned  
- Cost and time overruns  
- Low quality and buggy software  
- Difficult maintenance  
- User dissatisfaction  

**Famous Examples:**  
- Ariane 5 Rocket explosion (1996) due to software bug  
- NASA Mars Climate Orbiter loss (1999) due to metric/imperial mismatch  
- Denver Airport baggage system delay (1994)

## Software Myths

Even after the software crisis, **false beliefs** about software continued among managers, developers, and users.

### Management Myths
- “Adding more people will speed up the project.” ❌ Often slows it down due to training.
- “Software is done once written.” ❌ Maintenance is continuous.  
- “Requirements can change anytime easily.” ❌ Expensive and risky.  

### Developer Myths
- “Just write code that works.” ❌ Must be maintainable, documented, and tested.  
- “Once software works, we’re done.” ❌ Continuous updates required.  
- “Errors can be fixed later.” ❌ Costlier to fix bugs late.  

### Customer (User) Myths
- “Software is easy to change.” ❌ Even small changes can affect many parts.  
- “Software is 100% bug-free.” ❌ No complex software is completely bug-free.  
- “General description is enough to start.” ❌ Precise requirements are necessary.

## How Software Engineering Solves the Crisis

- Introduces **structured methodologies** (SDLC, Agile, Waterfall)  
- Implements **project management principles**  
- Emphasizes **testing and quality assurance**  
- Uses **version control** (Git) and documentation  
- Ensures **team coordination and maintainable code**

## Recap

> - Software Crisis occurred due to complexity, poor planning, and lack of methods.  
> - Myths caused false expectations, project delays, and poor quality.  
> - Software Engineering provides structure, methodology, and tools to deliver **reliable, maintainable, and scalable software**.
