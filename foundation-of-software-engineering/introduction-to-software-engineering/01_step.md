## Definition of Hardware

### Simple Definition
> Hardware is the **physical part of a computer system** â€” the components you can **see and touch**.

### Examples
- Monitor  
- Keyboard  
- Mouse  
- CPU (Processor)  
- RAM  
- Hard Disk  
- Printer  

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If you can kick it or touch it, itâ€™s hardware.

## Definition of Software

### Simple Definition
> Software is a **set of instructions or programs** that tell the hardware **what to do**.

### Examples
- Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, macOS  
- Applications: Chrome, VS Code, WhatsApp  
- Games: FIFA, Fortnite  

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If you canâ€™t touch it but you can use it, itâ€™s software.

## Key Differences

### 1. Nature
> - Hardware: Tangible, physical  
> - Software: Intangible, logical  

### 2. Creation
> - Hardware: Made in factories  
> - Software: Developed by programmers  

### 3. Dependency
> - Hardware can exist without software but is useless  
> - Software requires hardware to run  

### 4. Failure
> - Hardware: Fails physically (burn, break)  
> - Software: Fails logically (bugs, crashes)  

### 5. Lifespan
> - Hardware: Wears out over time  
> - Software: Doesnâ€™t wear out, but may become obsolete

## Real-World Analogy

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Hardware | Smartphone body, screen, battery, camera |
| Software | WhatsApp, Instagram, iOS/Android OS |

ðŸ’¬ Hardware is like the **body**, software is like the **soul** that makes it alive.

## Recap
> ### Relationship Between Software and Hardware
> - Software **gives instructions**.  
> - Hardware **executes** those instructions.
