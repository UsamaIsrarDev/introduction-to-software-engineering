## Software Characteristics

Software has unique qualities that make it different from hardware.

### a. Developed, Not Manufactured
- Software is **engineered**, not produced in a factory.
- Example: WhatsApp is developed using coding, testing, and design — not manufactured.

### b. Doesn’t Wear Out
- Software does not physically degrade, but it may become **obsolete**.
- Example: Windows XP still runs but is outdated.

### c. Custom-Built
- Software is often **tailored for specific needs**.
- Example: A banking app vs. a food delivery app — completely different systems.

### d. Complex
- Software can contain **millions of lines of code** and interact with many systems.
- Example: Instagram involves frontend, backend, database, and real-time APIs.

### e. Easily Changeable (Mutable)
- Software can be **updated or modified** quickly.
- Example: Mobile apps receive weekly updates for new features or bug fixes.

### f. Logical, Not Physical
- Software is a set of **logical instructions**, not a physical object.
- Example: VS Code exists digitally — you cannot touch it.

### g. Engineered
- Software follows **engineering principles** — planning, testing, documentation.
- Example: Developing a hospital management system with Agile methodology.

## Software Applications

Software is used in **every aspect of life** — from computers to mobile phones to embedded systems.

### a. System Software
- Controls hardware and provides a platform for other software.
- Example: Operating systems like Windows, Linux, macOS.

### b. Application Software
- Performs tasks for users.
- Example: MS Word, Zoom, WhatsApp, food delivery apps.

### c. AI & Machine Learning Software
- Simulates human intelligence for learning and decision-making.
- Example: ChatGPT, Siri, self-driving cars.

### d. Business Software
- Helps organizations manage data and processes.
- Example: ERP systems, CRM software, QuickBooks.

### e. Embedded Software
- Runs inside hardware to control functions.
- Example: Software in ATMs, smart TVs, cars, or washing machines.

### g. Web & Cloud Software
- Runs via browsers or cloud platforms.
- Example: Gmail, Google Drive, Netflix, Canva.

### h. Entertainment & Gaming Software
- Used for fun, media, or simulations.  
- Example: FIFA, Fortnite, YouTube.

### i. Scientific & Engineering Software
- Used for research, analysis, and simulations.
- Example: MATLAB, AutoCAD, NASA simulation tools.

## Real-World Example: Mobile Banking App

Scope includes:  
- Requirement gathering (security, transactions, UI)  
- Designing backend & frontend  
- Developing using frameworks like React Native + Node.js  
- Testing transactions, login, security  
- Deploying on App Store / Play Store  
- Updating and fixing bugs regularly

## Recap

> - Software is **engineered, complex, mutable, and logical**.  
> - Software applications are **everywhere**: system software, applications, AI, embedded, web/cloud, gaming, and scientific.  
> - Proper software engineering ensures **reliability, maintainability, and scalability**.
