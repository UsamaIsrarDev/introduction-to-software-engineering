## Software Characteristics

Software has unique qualities that make it different from hardware.

### 1. Developed, Not Manufactured
> Software is **engineered**, not produced in a factory.  
> Example: WhatsApp is developed using coding, testing, and design — not manufactured.

### 2. Doesn’t Wear Out
> Software does not physically degrade, but it may become **obsolete**.  
> Example: Windows XP still runs but is outdated.

### 3. Custom-Built
> Software is often **tailored for specific needs**.  
> Example: A banking app vs. a food delivery app — completely different systems.

### 4. Complex
> Software can contain **millions of lines of code** and interact with many systems.  
> Example: Instagram involves frontend, backend, database, and real-time APIs.

### 5. Easily Changeable (Mutable)
> Software can be **updated or modified** quickly.  
> Example: Mobile apps receive weekly updates for new features or bug fixes.

### 6. Logical, Not Physical
> Software is a set of **logical instructions**, not a physical object.  
> Example: VS Code exists digitally — you cannot touch it.

### 7. Engineered
> Software follows **engineering principles** — planning, testing, documentation.  
> Example: Developing a hospital management system with Agile methodology.

## Software Applications

Software is used in **every aspect of life** — from computers to mobile phones to embedded systems.

### 1. System Software
> Controls hardware and provides a platform for other software.  
> Example: Operating systems like Windows, Linux, macOS.

### 2. Application Software
> Performs tasks for users.  
> Example: MS Word, Zoom, WhatsApp, food delivery apps.

### 3. AI & Machine Learning Software
> Simulates human intelligence for learning and decision-making.  
> Example: ChatGPT, Siri, self-driving cars.

### 4. Business Software
> Helps organizations manage data and processes.  
> Example: ERP systems, CRM software, QuickBooks.

### 5. Embedded Software
> Runs inside hardware to control functions.  
> Example: Software in ATMs, smart TVs, cars, or washing machines.

### 6. Web & Cloud Software
> Runs via browsers or cloud platforms.  
> Example: Gmail, Google Drive, Netflix, Canva.

### 7. Entertainment & Gaming Software
> Used for fun, media, or simulations.  
> Example: FIFA, Fortnite, YouTube.

### 8. Scientific & Engineering Software
> Used for research, analysis, and simulations.  
> Example: MATLAB, AutoCAD, NASA simulation tools.

## Real-World Example: Mobile Banking App

Scope includes:  
- Requirement gathering (security, transactions, UI)  
- Designing backend & frontend  
- Developing using frameworks like React Native + Node.js  
- Testing transactions, login, security  
- Deploying on App Store / Play Store  
- Updating and fixing bugs regularly

## Summary

> **Key Takeaways:**  
> - Software is **engineered, complex, mutable, and logical**.  
> - Software applications are **everywhere**: system software, applications, AI, embedded, web/cloud, gaming, and scientific.  
> - Proper software engineering ensures **reliability, maintainability, and scalability**.
