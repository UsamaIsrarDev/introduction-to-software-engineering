- Continuous delivery keeps users happy.

#### Cons:
- Less predictable timelines.
- Requires disciplined team collaboration.

## DevOps & Continuous Delivery

> __Definition:__
> DevOps is a culture and set of practices that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) for faster and reliable delivery.

#### Core Principles:

- Automation of builds, testing, deployment (CI/CD pipelines).
- Monitoring and feedback loops.
- Collaboration between development & operations teams.

### Continuous Delivery (CD):
- Automatically deploy code to production after passing tests.
- Ensures software is always in a releasable state.

__Example:__ Amazon or Netflix deploy code changes hundreds of times per day using DevOps pipelines.
