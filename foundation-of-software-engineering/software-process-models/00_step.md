# Software Process Models
> A software process model is a structured approach used to plan, design, develop, test, and maintain software. Think of it as the “recipe” or “roadmap” for creating software systematically.

### You will learn:
> - Waterfall Model
> - Incremental Model
> - Spiral Model
> - V-Model
> - Agile Methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming)
> - DevOps & Continuous Delivery

## Waterfall Model
> Definition:
> The Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.


#### Phases:
- __Requirements Analysis__ : Gather all software requirements from stakeholders.
- __System Design__ : Plan architecture, modules, and data flow.
- __Implementation__ : Code each module according to design.
- __Testing__ : Test the software for bugs and correctness.
- __Deployment__ : Install and deliver the software to the user.
- __Maintenance__ : Fix issues, update software as needed.

__Example__: Building a bridge—design first, then build foundations, then the structure, then finishing touches. You can’t skip steps.

#### Pros:

- Easy to understand & manage.
- Clear milestones & documentation.

#### Cons:

- Inflexible to changes.
- Late detection of errors.

__Note__ : Not ideal for complex or long-term projects.

## Incremental Model

> Definition:
> The software is designed, implemented, and tested in small increments. Each increment adds functional features.

#### Process:

- Start with a small, basic version of the system.
- Deliver it to the user.
- Collect feedback, then add more features in subsequent increments.

__Example__ : Mobile apps often release MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) first, then gradually add features like dark mode, push notifications, etc.

#### Pros:
- Early delivery of partial working software.
- Easier to accommodate changes.

#### Cons:
- Requires good planning for architecture.
- Integration between increments can be challenging.

__Note__ : Best for projects where requirements can evolve gradually.
