## Spiral Model

> __Definition:__
> The Spiral Model combines iterative development (like Incremental) with risk analysis. Development cycles through spirals, each representing a phase.

### Phases of a Spiral (for each loop):

- Planning – Identify objectives, requirements.
- Risk Analysis – Evaluate risks and alternatives.
- Engineering – Design, develop, and test.
- Evaluation – User reviews and feedback.

__Example:__ Developing a complex AI system. You build prototypes, evaluate risks, refine, and repeat in cycles.



#### Pros:
- Good for large, high-risk projects.
- Emphasizes risk assessment early.

#### Cons:
- Expensive and complex.
- Requires expert risk analysis.

## V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)

> __Definition:__
> An extension of Waterfall, where each development phase has a corresponding testing phase. The model forms a “V” shape.
